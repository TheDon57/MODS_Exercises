Truly one of the most fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. What's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:<br /><br />1. A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. Brilliant actors. Adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. Breathtaking scenery. And it doesn't matter if it's real or CGI, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. A talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. The transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn't put it down. He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. And speaking of the script! The one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. But there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. Beautiful soundtrack. There's not a song in this film that I haven't fallen for, and that's something considering I'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. The songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. If you're going to buy the film, I recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for \\\\\\\"If Only\\\\\\\", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.<br /><br />I do not work for the people who made Holes, by the way, I'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves. If you haven't seen it, do it. Now. This very instant. Go!\",\n          \"The movie is great and I like the story. I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and Highlander ( silly movie ).

        "### Tokenize documents\n",
        "First, we tokenize the texts. This means we transform the texts from one long string to a list of tokens. Additionally we also start removing unwanted characters (e.g punctuation between sentences, numbers, etc.).\n",
        "For a full list and explanation of the used parameters you can have a look at the documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the code, we use `nltk.word_tokenize(text)` to break the input text into individual words or tokens. This is the first step in preprocessing, as computers need to work with smaller units rather than entire sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stem all words\n",
        "After tokenizing the texts we perform stemming (alternatively lemmatization could be performed). Stemming reduces every word to its stem.\n",
        "The stemmer we use here is the Porter Stemmer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we create a `PorterStemmer` object from NLTK. Then, for each token, we apply `stemmer.stem(token)` to reduce words to their root form. For example, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" might all be reduced to \"run\". This helps in grouping similar words together, making the analysis more consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Remove stopwords\n",
        "Finally we remove words that don't contain real meaning and are commonly used (e.g. 'this', 'the', 'a', etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "We get a list of English stopwords using `nltk.corpus.stopwords.words(\"english\")`. Then, we filter out any stemmed tokens that are in this list (case-insensitive). Stopwords are common words that don't carry much sentiment or meaning, so removing them reduces noise in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Remove punctuation\n",
        "Additionally, we remove any remaining punctuation marks from the filtered tokens. This is done by checking if each token is not in `string.punctuation`, which contains common punctuation characters like '.', ',', '!', etc. This further cleans the text by eliminating non-alphabetic characters that aren't useful for sentiment analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function `preprocess(text)` combines all these steps and returns a list of cleaned, stemmed tokens without stopwords or punctuation.\n",

Truly one of the most fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. What's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:<br /><br />1. A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. Brilliant actors. Adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. Breathtaking scenery. And it doesn't matter if it's real or CGI, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. A talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. The transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn't put it down. He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. And speaking of the script! The one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising. But there are also parts to make you smile, make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more. 7. Beautiful soundtrack. There's not a song in this film that I haven't fallen for, and that's something considering I'm supposed to be a punk-rocker. The songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film. If you're going to buy the film, I recommend you buy the soundtrack too, especially for \\\\\\\"If Only\\\\\\\", which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book.<br /><br />I do not work for the people who made Holes, by the way, I'm just a fan, plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves. If you haven't seen it, do it. Now. This very instant. Go!\",\n          \"The movie is great and I like the story. I prefer this movie than other movie such The cell ( sick movie ) and Highlander ( silly movie ).

        "We load the Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) model. It is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media texts. VADER uses a pre-built dictionary of words with sentiment intensities and applies rules for handling context like negations, intensifiers, and emoticons. It provides four polarity scores for a given text: positive, negative, neutral, and a compound score (ranging from -1 to +1) that summarizes overall sentiment. It's fast, doesn't require training data, and works well on short, informal texts like tweets or reviews, though it may not capture nuanced context as well as machine learning models. In this notebook, VADER is used as an alternative to the NRC dictionary-based approach for sentiment analysis on IMDB reviews."
